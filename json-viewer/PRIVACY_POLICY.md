# Privacy Policy for JSON Viewer

## Last Updated: January 25, 2024

## Introduction

JSON Viewer is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our browser extension collects, uses, and safeguards your information when you use our extension.

## Information We Do Not Collect

JSON Viewer does **not** collect, store, or transmit:
- Personal information
- Browsing history
- The content of web pages you visit
- The JSON data that is formatted by the extension

## Local Storage

JSON Viewer stores the following information locally on your device using Chrome's storage API:
- Your preference settings (theme, font size, default view mode, etc.)
- Recent JSON formatting history (URLs only, not the actual JSON content)

This data never leaves your device and is only used to enhance your experience with the extension.

## Permission Usage

JSON Viewer requires several permissions to function properly:

### activeTab
This permission allows the extension to detect and format JSON content in your currently active tab. It is only activated when you visit a page containing JSON content and does not allow access to your browsing history or other tabs.

### storage
This permission is used solely to save your preference settings locally on your device.

### scripting
This permission enables the extension to inject the necessary scripts to identify and format JSON content on web pages. These scripts run locally and do not transmit any data externally.

### host permissions (`<all_urls>`)
This permission allows the extension to automatically detect and format JSON on any website. We do not use this permission to collect or track your browsing activity.

## Remote Services

The Diagram View feature uses an iframe from JSONCrack.com to visualize JSON data. When you use this feature:
- The JSON data is processed locally in your browser
- No personal information is sent to JSONCrack.com
- This functionality is optional and only activated when you explicitly choose the Diagram View

## Data Security

Since we do not collect any user data, there is no risk of data breaches or unauthorized access to your personal information through our extension.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.

## Compliance

JSON Viewer is designed to comply with:
- Google Chrome Web Store Developer Program Policies
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
